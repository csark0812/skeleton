# Customize

**Source of truth for** skill customize overrides via hooks.

<!-- doc-meta: owner=eng | last-reviewed=2026-07-15 -->

Hook inject failures: [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md). `customize.alwaysInclude` key: [config](config.md).

## Layout

```
.skeleton/customize/<slug>.md
```

`skeleton init` wires IDE hooks to a cwd-local
`node node_modules/@csark0812/skeleton/dist/cli.js hook customize` (so runners that
lack `node_modules/.bin` on `PATH` still work). Inside this repo the hook runs
`bun src/cli.ts hook customize`.
Customize Markdown is always included in skeleton's audit corpus; consumers do
not add `.skeleton/customize/**` to `scan.include`.

## Inject gates

| Triggers inject                                                                                                                                         | Does not inject                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Read` / `read_file` of a path ending in `/SKILL.md`                                                                                                    | `Grep`, shell `cat`/`head`                                      |
| `Read` / `read_file` under a skill tree (`.claude/skills/<slug>/**`, `.agents/skills/<slug>/**`, or flat `<slug>/references/**` when that skill exists) | Non-skill paths (no resolvable slug)                            |
| Claude `Skill` tool (slug from tool input)                                                                                                              | Missing/unresolvable local package CLI (hooks no-op / fail)     |

### Host matchers (init templates)

| Host        | Matcher(s)                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Cursor      | `Read` only (no Claude-style Skill tool) |
| Claude Code | `Read` + `Skill`                         |
| Codex       | `read_file` only                         |

## `alwaysInclude`

In `.skeleton/config.yaml`:

```yaml
customize:
  alwaysInclude:
    - shared-agent-references.md
```

On every inject for slug `X`, the hook and `skeleton customize resolve X` concatenate:

1. `.skeleton/customize/X.md` (if present and non-empty)
2. Each listed basename under `.skeleton/customize/` (skip if it is the same file as `X.md`)

If the slug file is missing or empty but `alwaysInclude` resolves content, inject still fires.

Recommended for toolbox consumers: put the consumer `references/*` → docs remap table in `shared-agent-references.md` and list it under `alwaysInclude` so agents do not need a second hop.

## Manual resolve

```bash
skeleton customize resolve code-review
skeleton customize resolve code-review --json
# or, from a consumer repo: bunx skeleton customize resolve code-review
```

There is no `bun run skeleton customize …` script by default — use the `skeleton` bin from `@csark0812/skeleton`.

## Register customize files

```bash
skeleton register .skeleton/customize/code-review.md
```

Do not edit synced toolbox `SKILL.md` files — override in `.skeleton/customize/`.

Synced foreign skill bodies (declared in `skills-lock.json` with non-`local` provenance) are skipped by consumer `audit skills` / validate routing; the owning toolbox repo runs skill-body lint. Customize overlays and `.skeleton` config stay in this repo's audit corpus — see [config](config.md#skillownership).

If resolve works but IDE inject does not, see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#customize-hook-not-injecting).
